# Flashcard
This project is one of my most meaningful endeavors because, after my favorite study app, Quizlet, started charging, I challenged myself to code it.

Through this project, I was able to learn about hashsets, how to create the effect of moving through different screens, and gridbaglayout

I also used past skills of reading from files

In this project, you are first prompted on whether you want to enter multiple-choice mode or written mode. If you get an answer incorrect, it will still be included in the card list to implement those effective study skills of active recall.
